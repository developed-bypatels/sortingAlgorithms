# sortingAlgorithms
Evaluated the Sort Algorithms that were presented in class for efficiency. Sort methods (bubbleSort, selectionSort, insertionSort, mergeSort and quickSort) that are to be evaluated. Added code to each of the methods to count the number of comparisons required to completely sort the data. Ensured that each generate has used the same data for each sort.

# List in order (fastest to slowest) your selection of algorithm to use when the sort contain 25 elements.  
As per my obervation on sorting 25 elements through different algorithms 
  - My preference in selecting the algorithm for sorting is as follows: Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort
  
  Reason behind giving this preference is it takes less compares to sort algortihms and less time in execution.
        
# List in order (fastest to slowest) your selection of algorithm to use when the sort contain 25000 elements.
As per my obeservation on sorting 25000 elements through different algorithms
  - My preference in selecting the algorithm for sorting is as follows: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort
        
# List the algorithm and the BIG O notation for that algorithm. 
  - Quick Sort        = O(n log(n))
  - Merge Sort        = O(n log(n))
  - Bubble Sort       = O(n)
  - Insertion Sort    = O(n)
  - Selection Sort    = O(n^2)
        
# Which algorithm has the best performance of the basic step?  Does this have any impact on your selection of fastest algorithm when sorting 25000 elements.
  - Best Performance in sorting the most basic array was Quick Sort.
  - While selecting algorithm for sorting 25000 elements the algorithm with lesser comparison and less execution speed is preferred where quick Sort laid behind by Merge Sort in both terms
